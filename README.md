# JavaScript TicTacToe Using VueJS 3

While I could have used vanilla JS to make this simple game, I thought it would be fun to figure out how to make tic-tac-toe using VueJS.
This game follows traditional tic-tac-toe rules.  If you want to copy this project, make sure you do ```npm install``` and ```npm install vue@latest```, then use the following command in your terminal: 

``` 
git clone https://github.com/kennerhartman/tictactoe-js.git
```

### Project setup
```
vue create {project name}
```

```
git clone https://github.com/kennerhartman/tictactoe-js.git
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
